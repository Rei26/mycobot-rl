# myCobot 280 Pi – Reinforcement Learning Grasping

This repository contains the simulation and reinforcement learning setup for a **myCobot 280 Pi with adaptive gripper**, developed as part of a master’s thesis.

The project uses **Isaac Sim 5.x** for physics simulation and **Isaac Lab** for reinforcement learning experiments.

## Project Goals
- Learn a grasping task with a myCobot 280 Pi in simulation
- Study **collision handling and uncertainty** in manipulation
- Study **energy-efficient reward shaping** and performance trade-offs
- Prepare a clean path toward **sim-to-real transfer**

## Repository Structure
